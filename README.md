## Features

-   [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) or [Trakt.tv](https://www.trakt.tv/) integration for enhanced media information.
-   Optional minimal mode for Rich Presence to hide granular information
-   Lightweight console application that runs in the background.
-   Support for two-factor authentication (2FA) at login.
-   Prioritize multiple Plex media servers and users with one configuration.

## Setup

Perplex is built for [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/) or greater. [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) credentials are required to enable media art and external information.

Note: A Discord desktop client must be connected on the same device that Perplex is running on.

1. Install required dependencies using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `poetry install`
2. Rename `config_example.json` to `config.json`, then provide the configurable values.
3. Start Perplex: `python perplex.py`

**Trakt**:
You will need to create a new application on [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications/new) to obtain a client ID. The application name and description can be anything you want. The application redirect URI must be `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`.
